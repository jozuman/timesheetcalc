timesheetcalc
=============
this is a simple time summing webapp I made in a few hours to easily calculate how much time I spend on stuff.

the idea came from: http://timesheetcalc.com/

this source code can be found at: https://github.com/jozuman/timesheetcalc/

Also! AM and PM are not required if the time is during business hours (6AM - 5:59PM). It will assume the correct time.
